# Data source (CDC)
# Check Processing Application Functionalities

## 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- **Login/Logout**: Secure login and logout functionality.
- **User Roles**: Different roles (e.g., admin, teller) with specific permissions.

## 2. Check Scanning
- **Check Image Capture**: Use a scanner or a mobile device camera to capture the image of a check.
- **Image Quality Verification**: Ensure the scanned image meets the quality standards for processing.

## 3. Data Extraction
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract text from the check image, including account number, routing number, check number, date, payee, amount, memo, and signature.
- **Data Validation**: Validate the extracted data for accuracy (e.g., check that the date is in a valid format, the amount is numeric).

## 4. Check Processing
- **Duplicate Check Detection**: Check for duplicate checks to avoid processing the same check multiple times.
- **Fraud Detection**: Implement fraud detection algorithms to identify potential fraudulent checks.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple checks in batches for efficiency.

## 5. Data Management
- **Check Database**: Store check details in a secure database.
- **Search and Retrieval**: Allow users to search for and retrieve check details based on various criteria (e.g., date range, payee name).
- **Archiving**: Archive processed checks for record-keeping and compliance purposes.

## 6. Integration
- **Banking System Integration**: Integrate with the bank's core banking system to update account balances and transaction history.
- **Third-Party Services**: Integrate with third-party services for enhanced functionalities like address verification or additional fraud checks.

## 7. Reporting
- **Transaction Reports**: Generate reports on processed checks, including total amounts, number of checks processed, etc.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of all actions taken in the system for audit purposes.

## 8. User Interface
- **Dashboard**: A dashboard showing summary statistics and recent activity.
- **Check Entry Form**: A form to manually enter check details if needed.
- **Notifications**: Alerts and notifications for users (e.g., successful processing, errors, potential fraud).

## 9. Security
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained access controls to restrict access to sensitive functionalities.

## Example of a Simple Workflow

1. **Login**: User logs into the system.
2. **Scan Check**: User scans the check using the application.
3. **OCR and Validation**: The system extracts and validates the check details.
4. **Process Check**: The check details are processed, including updating the bankâ€™s database and running fraud checks.
5. **Store and Archive**: The processed check details are stored, and the image is archived.
6. **Generate Reports**: The system generates reports and updates the dashboard.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/Vue/Angular for user interface.
- **Back-End**: Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Java/Spring Boot for server-side logic.
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB for storing check details.
- **OCR**: Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Textract for text extraction.
- **Security**: SSL/TLS for data encryption, OAuth2/JWT for authentication.

Implementing these functionalities would require careful planning and integration of various technologies to ensure a robust and secure check processing application.
